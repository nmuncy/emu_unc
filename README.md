# emu_unc

Scripts and data used to investigate the interaction of clinical diagnosis and tract with memory performance, amygdaloid activity during emotional judgments, and amygdaloid connectivity with nodes in emotional memory systems.

# code
Contains the scripts for processing functional and diffusional data as well as conducting statistical tests. Name consists of data type (diff, func), order in workstream (func1 precedes func2), and short description of utility. Wrapper scripts are called `fooX_submit.ext`.

Six main steps occurred when processing and analyzing data:
1. Pre-processing functional data via [https://github.com/emu-project/func_processing](https://github.com/emu-project/func_processing).
2. Additional pre-processing of functional data, deconvolution, and ROI coefficient extraction via scripts `func0`-`func3`. 
3. Functional PPI analysis with ROI and exploratory analyses via `func4`-`func8` (`func8` exploratory currently unused).
4. Diffusion pre-processing as reported [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221315822200002X).
5. Tract modeling via AFQ via scripts `diff1`-`diff2`.
6. Statistical tests of diffusion interactions with other metrics via `diff4`.

# data
Raw data generated by the workstream, and formatted dataframes used in analyses.

* Diffusion data:

  * `tract_profiles.csv` - raw output generated by AFQ
  * `AFQ_dataframe.csv` - formatted dataframe of AFQ, with extra participant information included

* Functional data:

  * `Coef_*_<amgL | amgR | NSlacc | NSldmpfc | NSlsfs>.txt` - raw output of ROI coefficients extracted during Study scence valence judgments. Currently only the amgL, amgR are used.
  * `df_*_<amgL | amgR | NSlacc | NSldmpfc | NSlsfs>.txt` - formatted dataframes of above ROI coefficients, used for analyses.
  * `Coef_*_amgL-<NSlacc | NSldmpfc | NSlsfs>.txt` - raw output of PPI coefficients between a left amygdala seed and other ROIs.
  * `df_*_amgL-<NSlacc | NSldmpfc | NSlsfs>.txt` - formatted dataframes of above PPI coefficients, used for analyses.
 
* `timing_files`:
  
  * Directory containing timing and reference JSON files needed by [https://github.com/emu-project/func_processing](https://github.com/emu-project/func_processing) (`workflow.control_afni.control_deconvolution`).
